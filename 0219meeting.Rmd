#Review & Summarize
###1.	What is positivity violation?

To identify the Actual causal Effect(ACE), 4 assumptions need to be satisfied, and positivity is one of them. It means if __P(A=a|C=c)is positive for all C such that P(C=c) is nonzero__ does not hold, ACE cannot be identified so it is meaningless to calculate the "formula" ACE.

###2.	What is the difference between $E[Y_{e_(75th)} - Y_{e^*_25th}]$ and $E[Y_{g(A)}-Y_{g(A)^*}]$

Since it is a multi-exporsure analysis, we specify it as one metal first.
$E[Y_{e_(75th)} - Y_{e^*_25th}]$ means using descriptive characteristics (eg.75 percentile,25 percentile) to estimate the causal effect.
$E[Y_{g(A)}-Y_{g(A)^*}]$ means using different distributions when estimating the causal effect.

###3.	What does E[A|C] mean? 
###4.	How to generate E[A|C]?
###5.	What is the DAG of this study after simplifying?
###6.	Whatâ€™s the structure relationship between sample size, simulation size and bootstrap size ?
###7.	How to utilize linear regression to fit E[Y|A,C]?
###8.	What is MSM? 
###9.	What will be solved after fitting MSM? How to fit MSM
###10.	What does the following mean, where do they come from?
